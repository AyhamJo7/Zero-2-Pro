# Advanced: Concurrency Patterns, Context, and Backpressure

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will:

- [ ] Apply advanced concurrency patterns (worker pools, fan-in/out, pipelines)
- [ ] Master context.Context for cancellation and timeouts
- [ ] Implement backpressure and flow control mechanisms
- [ ] Build scalable concurrent systems

## Prerequisites

- Completion of go-03-project-service
- Strong understanding of goroutines and channels
- Experience with HTTP services in Go

## Module Structure

### Part 1: Advanced Concurrency Patterns
**TODO:** Worker pools, pipelines, fan-in/fan-out, and select patterns

### Part 2: Context Mastery
**TODO:** Context propagation, cancellation, deadlines, and values

### Part 3: Backpressure & Flow Control
**TODO:** Rate limiting, buffering strategies, and graceful degradation

### Part 4: Performance & Profiling
**TODO:** pprof, benchmarking, and optimization techniques

## Final Project

Build a high-throughput data processing service that:
- Processes thousands of concurrent requests
- Implements proper context handling and cancellation
- Includes backpressure and flow control
- Demonstrates measurable performance characteristics

## Assessment Criteria

- Effective use of advanced concurrency patterns
- Proper context usage throughout the application
- Robust backpressure handling under load
- Evidence-based performance optimization

## Resources & References

**TODO:** Add links to Go concurrency guides, pprof documentation, and performance case studies

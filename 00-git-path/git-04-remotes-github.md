# Remotes & GitHub: clone, fetch, pull, push, PR

- `git remote add origin <url>`
- `git push -u origin main` sets upstream.
- `git fetch` downloads references; `git pull` fetches **and** merges/rebases.

## Exercises

- Fork a repo or create a new one.
- Push local commits; open a PR from a branch; request a review.

## Checklist

- [ ] Remote added
- [ ] Branch pushed with `-u`
- [ ] PR created and merged

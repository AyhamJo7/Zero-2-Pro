# Community Progress Dashboard

*Last updated: 2024-12-20*

This dashboard shows learners who are actively working through the Zero-to-Pro tracks and sharing their progress.

## ðŸŒ± Getting Started

No active progress reports yet! Be the first to share your journey:

1. **Start a track** from our [available tracks](../tracks/index.md)
2. **Open a Progress Issue** using our template
3. **Update your progress** as you complete modules
4. **Celebrate milestones** with the community

### How to Share Your Progress

Use the [Progress Report issue template](https://github.com/AyhamJo7/Zero-2-Pro/issues/new?template=progress.md) to:

- Set your learning goals
- Track module completions
- Share challenges and victories
- Get support from other learners

### Benefits of Sharing

- **Accountability**: Public commitment increases completion rates

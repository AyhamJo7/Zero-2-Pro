# Advanced: Hardening Playbook (Lab only)

Create a short **threat model**, implement a **hardening playbook**, and capture **verification**. Focus on legal, isolated environments.

## Tasks
- Threat model (assets, actors, STRIDE analysis) for your L3 app.
- Apply headers (CSP, HSTS), input validation, rate limiting, secrets handling.
- Add dependency/secrets scanning and document results.
- Provide a verification checklist with evidence.

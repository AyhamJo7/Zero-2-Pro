# Python Level-3 Challenges

These stretch challenges extend the **py-03-project-cli** milestone with advanced Python concepts and real-world applications.

## Challenge 1: Async CLI Tool

Convert your CLI to async patterns:

- Async HTTP requests and file I/O
- Concurrent task execution
- Progress bars for long-running operations
- Graceful cancellation handling

**Skills developed:** asyncio, concurrent programming, user experience

## Challenge 2: Plugin Architecture

Add extensible plugin system:

- Dynamic plugin loading and discovery
- Plugin API design and documentation
- Configuration management for plugins
- Plugin lifecycle management

**Skills developed:** Dynamic imports, API design, extensibility patterns

## Challenge 3: Advanced Data Processing

Implement high-performance data handling:

- Stream processing for large datasets
- Memory-efficient algorithms
- Integration with pandas/numpy
- Data validation and transformation pipelines

**Skills developed:** Stream processing, data science libraries, algorithms

## Challenge 4: Distributed Processing

Add distributed computing capabilities:

- Message queue integration (Redis/RabbitMQ)
- Worker processes with task distribution
- Result aggregation and monitoring
- Fault tolerance and retry mechanisms

**Skills developed:** Message queues, distributed systems, fault tolerance

## Challenge 5: Production Deployment

Package for production distribution:

- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- PyPI package publication
- CI/CD with automated testing
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

**Skills developed:** Packaging, distribution, CI/CD, containerization

## Getting Started

1. Select 2-3 challenges aligned with your interests
2. Extend your existing py-03 CLI project
3. Document design decisions and trade-offs
4. Create comprehensive tests for new features

# Java Level-3 Challenges

These stretch challenges extend the **java-03-project-service** milestone with enterprise Java patterns and technologies.

## Challenge 1: Microservices Architecture

Decompose your service into microservices:

- Service discovery and registration
- Inter-service communication patterns
- Distributed configuration management
- Circuit breaker implementation

**Skills developed:** Microservices patterns, Spring Cloud, resilience

## Challenge 2: Event-Driven Architecture

Implement event-driven patterns:

- Message brokers (Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Event sourcing and CQRS patterns
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Event streaming and processing

**Skills developed:** Event sourcing, message brokers, distributed transactions

## Challenge 3: Advanced Data Persistence

Enhance data layer capabilities:

- Multi-database support (SQL + NoSQL)
- Connection pooling and optimization
- Database migration strategies
- Caching layers (Redis, Caffeine)

**Skills developed:** Database design, caching strategies, data access patterns

## Challenge 4: Security & Compliance

Implement enterprise security:

- OAuth2 and JWT token management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging and compliance

**Skills developed:** Security frameworks, compliance, authentication

## Challenge 5: Performance & Monitoring

Add production-ready observability:

- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Custom metrics and dashboards
- JVM tuning and garbage collection
- Load testing and profiling

**Skills developed:** Performance tuning, JVM internals, monitoring tools

## Getting Started

# Advanced: Resilient Services & Observability

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will:

- [ ] Implement circuit breakers, retries, and timeout patterns
- [ ] Set up metrics, tracing, and logging for production services
- [ ] Handle distributed system failures gracefully
- [ ] Apply chaos engineering principles

## Prerequisites

- Completion of java-03-project-service
- Understanding of REST APIs and Spring Boot
- Basic knowledge of distributed systems

## Module Structure

### Part 1: Resilience Patterns
**TODO:** Circuit breakers, bulkheads, timeouts, and retry strategies

### Part 2: Observability Stack
**TODO:** Metrics with Micrometer, tracing with Zipkin, structured logging

### Part 3: Production Readiness
**TODO:** Health checks, graceful shutdown, configuration management

### Part 4: Chaos Engineering
**TODO:** Fault injection, load testing, and failure scenario testing

## Final Project

Build a resilient microservice that:
- Implements multiple resilience patterns
- Provides comprehensive observability
- Handles various failure scenarios gracefully
- Includes chaos engineering tests

## Assessment Criteria

- Proper implementation of resilience patterns
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Evidence of failure scenario testing
- Production-ready configuration and deployment

## Resources & References

**TODO:** Add links to Spring Cloud, resilience libraries, and observability tools

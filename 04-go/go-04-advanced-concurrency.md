# Advanced: Concurrency Patterns

Design a **pipeline** that ingests jobs, processes them via worker pools, and exposes status endpoints. Propagate **context** cancellations and handle backpressure. Provide benchmarks and profiles.

## Tasks
- Implement fan-out workers with bounded queues and backpressure.
- Ensure context cancellation stops work promptly; no goroutine leaks.
- Add shutdown hooks; verify graceful termination under load.
- Benchmark variants and share results.

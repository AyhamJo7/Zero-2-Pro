# 00 — Git Path (Mandatory)

Everyone starts here. By the end you'll:
- Understand Git's mental model (commits, DAG, HEAD)
- Work locally (init, status, add, commit, log)
- Branch, merge, and resolve conflicts
- Use remotes and GitHub (clone, fetch, pull, push, PRs)
- Rebase safely and keep a clean history
- Debug with `bisect`, and inspect with `show`/`blame`

**How to progress:** Complete modules in order `git-01` → `git-06`. Each module has a proof-of-work deliverable you'll link in your PR.

# Project Rubric

This rubric defines quality standards for Zero-to-Pro projects, particularly Level-3 milestone projects.

## Technical Implementation (40%)

### Excellent (90-100%)
- Code is clean, well-structured, and follows language conventions
- Proper error handling and edge case management
- Efficient algorithms and data structures
- Security considerations implemented
- Performance optimized where appropriate

### Good (80-89%)
- Code is mostly clean with minor structural issues
- Basic error handling implemented
- Standard algorithms and approaches used
- Some security considerations present
- Adequate performance for intended use

### Satisfactory (70-79%)
- Code works but may have structural problems
- Minimal error handling
- Basic implementation without optimization
- Limited security considerations
- Performance acceptable for basic use

### Needs Improvement (Below 70%)
- Code has significant structural or functional issues
- Poor or missing error handling
- Inefficient or incorrect implementation
- Security vulnerabilities present
- Poor performance or reliability

## Documentation (25%)

### Excellent (90-100%)
- Comprehensive README with clear setup instructions
- Code comments where necessary
- API documentation if applicable
- Usage examples and screenshots
- Contribution guidelines for open projects

### Good (80-89%)
- Good README with setup instructions
- Some code comments
- Basic usage documentation
- Examples provided

### Satisfactory (70-79%)
- Basic README present
- Minimal comments
- Setup instructions may be unclear
- Limited examples

### Needs Improvement (Below 70%)
- Poor or missing documentation
- No clear setup instructions
- Difficult to understand project purpose or usage

## Testing (20%)

### Excellent (90-100%)
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests where appropriate
- Edge case testing
- Automated test runner configured

### Good (80-89%)
- Good test coverage (60-80%)
- Unit tests for main features
- Basic integration testing
- Test runner configured

### Satisfactory (70-79%)
- Basic test coverage (40-60%)
- Some unit tests present
- Manual testing documented

### Needs Improvement (Below 70%)
- Poor test coverage (<40%)
- Missing critical tests
- No testing documentation

## Professional Practices (15%)

### Excellent (90-100%)
- Version control used effectively
- Clear commit messages
- Project structure follows conventions
- Dependencies managed properly
- Deployment considerations included

### Good (80-89%)
- Good use of version control
- Decent commit messages
- Reasonable project structure
- Dependencies mostly managed

### Satisfactory (70-79%)
- Basic version control usage
- Some project organization
- Dependencies present but may be unclear

### Needs Improvement (Below 70%)
- Poor version control practices
- Disorganized project structure
- Dependency issues

## Overall Project Standards

**Minimum Requirements (All Projects):**
- Project builds and runs without errors
- Core functionality works as described
- Basic README with setup instructions
- At least some test coverage
- Clean repository (no temporary files, secrets, etc.)

**Level-3 Milestone Additional Requirements:**
- Demonstrates integration of multiple course concepts
- Includes professional development practices
- Shows consideration for real-world usage
- Portfolio-quality presentation
- Evidence of iterative development and improvement

## Self-Assessment Guide

When evaluating your project, consider:

1. **Would I be comfortable sharing this with potential employers?**
2. **Can someone else easily set up and run my project?**
3. **Does my code demonstrate the skills I intended to learn?**
4. **Have I followed the conventions of my chosen technology stack?**
5. **Is my project something I would want to maintain and extend?**

## Getting Feedback

- Use GitHub Discussions for project review requests
- Participate in community code review sessions
- Ask specific questions about areas you're uncertain about
- Share your self-assessment and areas where you want improvement

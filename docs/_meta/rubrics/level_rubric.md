# Level Rubric (0–4)

Use this rubric to set expectations for each module's depth and outcomes.

## Level 0 — Zero (Orientation & Setup)
**Purpose:** Get from nothing to a working environment and basic mental models.
**Evidence:** Screenshots, CLI output, short reflection, or repo with trivial code.

**Checklist**
- [ ] Environment installed and verified
- [ ] Key terms defined in learner's own words
- [ ] First "hello world" or equivalent
- [ ] Short reflection: what I learned / where I got stuck

## Level 1 — Foundations (Syntax & Basics)
**Purpose:** Core vocabulary of the domain.
**Evidence:** Small exercises that touch most primitives.

**Checklist**
- [ ] At least 3 concrete outcomes demonstrated
- [ ] Exercises cover input/output, basic control flow or equivalents
- [ ] Simple error handling or debugging step
- [ ] Assessment includes a deliverable link (repo/gist)

## Level 2 — Core Skills (Real-World Tasks)
**Purpose:** Combine fundamentals into practical workflows.
**Evidence:** Mini-projects or tasks mirroring real usage.

**Checklist**
- [ ] Uses tooling, testing, or validation
- [ ] Performs I/O, persistence, or network call (domain-appropriate)
- [ ] Includes README with run/test instructions
- [ ] Assessment has a rubric reference

## Level 3 — Projects (Portfolio)
**Purpose:** Build something end-to-end with scope, constraints, and review.
**Evidence:** Public repo with docs, tests (where relevant), and demo.

**Checklist**
- [ ] Clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] CI or basic automation
- [ ] Tradeoff discussion in README
- [ ] Demo artifact (link, GIF, screenshots)

## Level 4 — Advanced (Depth/Specialization)
**Purpose:** Performance, scale, security, architecture, or advanced patterns.
**Evidence:** Benchmarks, profiles, security posture, or architecture write-up.

**Checklist**
- [ ] Measurable improvement or depth (e.g., perf/security)
- [ ] Reproducible experiments or load tests (domain-appropriate)
- [ ] Documented methodology and results
- [ ] Reflection on limitations and next steps

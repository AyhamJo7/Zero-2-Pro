# Local Basics: init, status, add, commit, log

Create a new directory and:

```bash
git init
echo "# notes" > notes.md
git add notes.md
git commit -m "Add notes file"
echo "first idea" >> notes.md
git add -p          # stage hunks interactively
git commit -m "Add idea to notes"
git log --oneline
```

## Exercises

1) Write three small commits with clear messages.
2) Use `git show <commit>` to view the diff.

## Checklist

- [ ] 3+ commits
- [ ] At least one interactive stage (`git add -p`)
- [ ] README explains commit intent

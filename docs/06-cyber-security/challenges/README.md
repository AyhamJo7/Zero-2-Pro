# Cyber Security Level-3 Challenges

These stretch challenges extend the **sec-03-project-harden-app** milestone with advanced security concepts and real-world scenarios.

## Challenge 1: Advanced Threat Detection

Implement sophisticated detection mechanisms:

- SIEM integration and log analysis
- Behavioral anomaly detection
- Machine learning for threat classification
- Threat intelligence integration

**Skills developed:** SIEM tools, anomaly detection, threat intelligence

## Challenge 2: Zero Trust Architecture

Design and implement zero trust principles:

- Identity and access management (IAM)
- Micro-segmentation strategies
- Continuous authentication and authorization
- Device compliance and attestation

**Skills developed:** Zero trust principles, IAM, network security

## Challenge 3: Incident Response Automation

Build automated response capabilities:

- Security orchestration and automated response (SOAR)
- Playbook automation for common incidents
- Threat hunting automation
- Integration with security tools and APIs

**Skills developed:** Security automation, incident response, tool integration

## Challenge 4: Advanced Penetration Testing

Develop comprehensive testing methodology:

- Automated vulnerability scanning integration
- Custom exploit development (ethical, controlled)
- Social engineering assessment frameworks
- Red team exercise planning and execution

**Skills developed:** Penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, red teaming

## Challenge 5: Compliance & Risk Management

Implement comprehensive compliance framework:

- GDPR, HIPAA, or SOC2 compliance implementation
- Risk assessment and management procedures
- Security metrics and KPI tracking
- Third-party security assessment processes

**Skills developed:** Compliance frameworks, risk management, security governance

## Getting Started

1. Select challenges aligned with your security career path
2. Extend your sec-03 hardening project
3. **Always operate within legal and ethical boundaries**
4. Document security controls and their effectiveness

## Important Notice

All security challenges must be performed in controlled, legal environments:

- Use dedicated lab environments only
- Never test on systems you don't own
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Comply with local laws and regulations

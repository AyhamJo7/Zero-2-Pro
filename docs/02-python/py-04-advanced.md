# Advanced: Async IO, Concurrency, and Profiling

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will:

- [ ] Master asyncio event loops, coroutines, and concurrent patterns
- [ ] Implement high-throughput async applications
- [ ] Profile Python applications and identify bottlenecks
- [ ] Apply advanced optimization techniques

## Prerequisites

- Completion of py-03-project-cli
- Solid understanding of Python fundamentals
- Experience with testing and packaging

## Module Structure

### Part 1: Asyncio Foundations
**TODO:** Deep dive into event loops, coroutines, tasks, and futures

### Part 2: Concurrent Patterns
**TODO:** Producer-consumer, worker pools, semaphores, and backpressure handling

### Part 3: Performance Profiling
**TODO:** cProfile, line_profiler, memory_profiler, and optimization strategies

### Part 4: Advanced Optimization
**TODO:** Cython, numba, and when to drop to C extensions

## Final Project

Build a high-performance async web scraper or data processor that:
- Handles thousands of concurrent requests
- Implements proper backpressure and rate limiting
- Includes comprehensive profiling and optimization
- Demonstrates measurable performance improvements

## Assessment Criteria

- Proper async/await usage and error handling
- Efficient resource utilization under load
- Evidence-based performance optimization
- Clean, maintainable concurrent code

## Resources & References

**TODO:** Add links to asyncio guides, profiling tools, and performance case studies

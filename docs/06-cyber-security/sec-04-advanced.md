# Advanced: Hardening Playbook & Threat Modeling

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will:

- [ ] Develop systematic security hardening procedures
- [ ] Conduct comprehensive threat modeling exercises
- [ ] Implement layered security controls
- [ ] Design incident response and monitoring systems

## Prerequisites

- Completion of sec-03-project-harden-app
- Strong understanding of security fundamentals
- Experience with security tools and practices

## Module Structure

### Part 1: Security Hardening Playbooks
**TODO:** Systematic hardening procedures for different environments and technologies

### Part 2: Threat Modeling Methodologies
**TODO:** STRIDE, attack trees, and risk assessment frameworks

### Part 3: Defense-in-Depth Implementation
**TODO:** Multiple security layers, controls, and monitoring integration

### Part 4: Incident Response & Monitoring
**TODO:** Detection, response procedures, and forensic considerations

## Final Project

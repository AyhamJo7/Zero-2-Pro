# Advanced: Resilience & Observability

Wrap outbound HTTP/database calls with **timeouts**, **retry + backoff**, and a **circuit breaker**. Emit metrics/traces/logs, run a short load test, and document SLOs and failure handling.

## Tasks
- Add client timeouts and bounded connection pools.
- Implement retry policy with jitter; guard with a circuit breaker.
- Emit metrics (latency, errors, retries) and a basic trace around a request.
- Load-test a steady and a failure scenario; add conclusions.

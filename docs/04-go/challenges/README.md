# Go Level-3 Challenges

These stretch challenges extend the **go-03-project-service** milestone with advanced Go patterns and distributed systems concepts.

## Challenge 1: gRPC Service Architecture

Transform your HTTP service to gRPC:

- Protocol buffer definitions and code generation
- Streaming RPC implementations
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Inter-service communication patterns

**Skills developed:** gRPC, protocol buffers, streaming, service mesh

## Challenge 2: High-Performance Concurrency

Optimize for extreme concurrency:

- Worker pools with backpressure handling
- Lock-free data structures where appropriate
- Context-based cancellation patterns
- Memory pool optimizations

**Skills developed:** Advanced concurrency, performance optimization, profiling

## Challenge 3: Cloud-Native Deployment

Build for cloud-native environments:

- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Configuration management with ConfigMaps
- Service mesh integration (Istio)

**Skills developed:** Kubernetes, cloud-native patterns, service mesh

## Challenge 4: Observability & Monitoring

Implement comprehensive observability:

- Structured logging with structured data
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Custom metrics and alerting
- Performance profiling integration

**Skills developed:** Observability tools, tracing, metrics, profiling

## Challenge 5: Data Pipeline Processing

Build high-throughput data processing:

- Stream processing with Apache Kafka
- ETL pipelines with proper error handling
- Batch processing with concurrency
- Data validation and transformation

**Skills developed:** Stream processing, data pipelines, message brokers

## Getting Started

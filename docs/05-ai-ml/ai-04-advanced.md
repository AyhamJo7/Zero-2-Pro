# Advanced: RAG Evaluation, Guardrails, and Observability

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will:

- [ ] Design and implement RAG evaluation pipelines
- [ ] Build safety guardrails and content filtering systems
- [ ] Set up comprehensive ML observability
- [ ] Handle production ML system challenges

## Prerequisites

- Completion of ai-03-project-mlapp
- Understanding of LLMs and RAG patterns
- Experience with ML evaluation metrics

## Module Structure

### Part 1: RAG Evaluation Frameworks
**TODO:** Retrieval metrics, generation quality, end-to-end evaluation

### Part 2: Safety & Guardrails
**TODO:** Content filtering, bias detection, prompt injection prevention

### Part 3: ML Observability
**TODO:** Model monitoring, drift detection, performance tracking

### Part 4: Production Challenges
**TODO:** Scaling, cost optimization, and model lifecycle management

## Final Project

Build a production-ready RAG system that:
- Includes comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Implements safety guardrails and content filtering
- Provides full observability and monitoring
- Demonstrates handling of production challenges

## Assessment Criteria

- Robust evaluation framework with relevant metrics
- Effective safety measures and guardrails
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Evidence of production readiness

## Resources & References

**TODO:** Add links to evaluation frameworks, safety tools, and observability platforms

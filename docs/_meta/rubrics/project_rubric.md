| Criterion                | 0 – Not Met                                   | 1 – Partial                                  | 2 – Meets                                       | 3 – Exceeds                                                |
|---                       |---                                            |---                                           |---                                              |---                                                         |
| **Scope & Requirements** | Missing major requirements                     | Some requirements unclear or missing         | All requirements implemented                    | Adds well-documented, sensible extras                      |
| **Correctness**          | Frequent errors; fails basic cases            | Works for common paths, edge cases fail      | Passes defined scenarios & edge cases           | Includes additional tests/specs; robust to unexpected input |
| **Code Quality**         | Disorganized; unclear structure               | Some structure; inconsistent style           | Clear modules, consistent style, comments       | Exceptional readability; thoughtful abstractions           |
| **Testing/Validation**   | None                                          | Minimal checks                               | Unit/integration tests or validation present    | High coverage; CI runs tests automatically                 |
| **Documentation**        | Missing or minimal                            | Basic README with run steps                  | Clear README (setup, run, test, decisions)      | Architecture diagram, tradeoffs, future work               |
| **DevEx/Automation**     | Hard to run; manual steps                     | Some scripts                                 | Scripts or Makefile; CI lint/checks             | Full CI, pre-commit hooks, reproducible env                |

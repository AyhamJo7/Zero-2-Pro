# Branches & Merges: Fast-forward, Three-way

Branches are movable pointers to commits. A **fast-forward** merge moves the pointer; a **three-way** merge creates a merge commit.

## Exercises

1) Create branch `feature/hello`, add a file, commit.
2) On `main`, edit the same line to trigger a conflict.
3) Merge and resolve with your editor, then `git commit`.

## Checklist

- [ ] New branch created and merged
- [ ] Conflict resolved intentionally
- [ ] Notes explaining what happened

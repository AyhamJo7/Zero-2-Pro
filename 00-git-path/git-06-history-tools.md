# Time Travel: log formats, blame, bisect, tags

- Pretty logs accelerate comprehension.
- `blame` shows last change per line; `bisect` binary-searches history to find regressions.
- Annotated tags (`-a`) are ideal for releases.

## Exercises

- Break a test intentionally; run `git bisect start`, mark good/bad until culprit found.
- Create `v0.1.0` as an annotated tag and push it.

## Checklist

- [ ] Graph log alias saved (optional)
- [ ] Bisect used to find a bug
- [ ] Tag created and pushed
